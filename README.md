# HR Analytics: EDA on Employee Attrition

## 📌 Project Objective
To explore and analyze HR data to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition and suggest potential actions for improving retention.

## 🧩 Dataset
- Source: [IBM HR Analytics Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- Rows: 1,470 | Columns: 35

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Descriptive Statistics
- Univariate and Bivariate Explorations
- Correlation Heatmaps
- Visualization of attrition trends by gender, department, job role, income, and more

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Departments like "Sales" and "Human Resources" and in Job Roles "Sales Representative" have higher attrition rates
- Higher attrition observed among younger employees and those doing overtime
- Employees with Bad Environment and Job Satisfaction were more likely to leave
- Employees with lower monthly income and fewer years since last promotion also showed higher turnover trends
- Work-Life Balance and overtime hours were also found to influence attrition directly

## 📌 Outcome
Based on the findings, I proposed HR-focused strategies such as revisiting promotion timelines, improving employee engagement in specific roles, and enhancing work-life balance. This project not only strengthened my data analysis and storytelling skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of how data can drive HR decision-making.
